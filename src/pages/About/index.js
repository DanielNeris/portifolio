          I'm 20 years old, I live in Brazil, in the countryside of Barra
          Bonita, in SÃ£o Paulo. I'm currently studying Computer Science at
          UNISAGRADO. I started in the technology area in mid-2016, when I took
          my first Computer Technician course and fell in love. I really like
          the JavaScript ecosystem and today I'm focused on studying Node.js,
          ReactJS and React Native. In my spare time, I like to play multiplayer
          games with my friends, listen to music, program and study English.
